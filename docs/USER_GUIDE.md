# amdtop User Guide

This guide explains the metrics `amdtop` displays, with an emphasis on the terms
that are not self-explanatory. On a Strix Halo APU the CPU, integrated GPU, and
NPU all share one power, thermal, and memory budget, so most of these numbers are
about understanding which shared limit a workload is hitting.

All data comes from the world-readable amdgpu `gpu_metrics` sysfs table (no root
required) plus standard `/proc` and `/sys` interfaces.

## iGPU metrics

- **gpu** - graphics engine busy percent (share of time the GFX block was active).
- **mem** - memory-controller busy percent.
- **vram** - unified video memory currently allocated out of the total carved for
  the iGPU.
- **gtt** - GTT (graphics translation table) memory: system RAM mapped for GPU use.
- **sclk** - GFX shader/engine clock in MHz. This is the headline "how fast is the
  GPU running" number.
- **temp** - GFX-die edge temperature in degrees C.
- **power** - GFX-rail power draw in watts (the GPU's own power, separate from the
  CPU cores).

## Throttle counters

The firmware exposes seven monotonic "throttle residency" accumulators - one per
throttler. Each is a running counter that only goes up; a positive change between
two samples (the delta) means that throttler was engaged during that interval.
`amdtop` plots the per-sample delta and shows both the absolute accumulator and
the latest delta in each plot header, for example `spl 52 (+4)`.

On this APU the CPU and GPU share a single package power budget, so a heavy GPU
workload is frequently clamped by the package power limits (fppt/sppt/spl) rather
than by the GPU's own thermal limit. The power limits differ only by the time
window they average over: fast, slow, and sustained.

### thm_gfx

GFX thermal throttle. Engages when the graphics die itself reaches its temperature
ceiling. This is the most GPU-specific throttle signal: if `thm_gfx` residency is
climbing, the GPU is being held back by heat, and better cooling would help. If it
is flat while the power throttles are active, the workload is power-limited rather
than thermal-limited.

### fppt

Fast Package Power Tracking. The shortest-window package power limit
(milliseconds). It catches the initial burst at the very start of a load spike and
then releases as the slower limits take over. Rarely the steady-state limiter, but
useful for seeing how aggressively a workload ramps.

### sppt

Slow Package Power Tracking. A seconds-scale sliding-average package power limit.
It governs the transition from "just started boosting" to steady state: it lets the
package run above the sustained number briefly by draining budget, then reels it
back down. Rising `sppt` residency means the boost window is closing.

### spl

Sustained Power Limit (also called STAPM, Skin-Temperature-Aware Power Management).
The long-term, steady-state package power ceiling (tens of seconds to minutes). It
is the "forever" number a workload settles to once the short-term boost budget is
spent. Because it is skin-temperature aware, the value depends on chassis cooling.
If `spl` residency is pegged during a sustained run, you have hit the permanent
power floor: more boost budget will not help, only a higher configured power limit
or shedding CPU load (since the budget is shared) will.

The package power family across time windows, shortest to longest:
`fppt` (burst) -> `sppt` (slow) -> `spl` (sustained).

## Reading the trend plots

Each plot is a fixed-width, 10-minute sliding window downsampled into buckets; each
bucket shows the peak value in its time slot. The vertical scale auto-fits the
session extremes (the sticky min and max learned since `amdtop` started), so the
bars grow to fill the plot as the run's true range emerges. The plot header shows
the current value plus that session `min` and `max`.

For the throttle plots the plotted quantity is the per-sample delta (the increment
in the residency accumulator since the previous sample), so a bar appears only when
that throttler was actually engaged during the interval.
